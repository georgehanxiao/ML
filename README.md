We are building a website aiming to helping team captains manage their team in NYC recreational leagues. The short survey will take 30 seconds and upon completion you will get an invitation code to be the first users to our beta testing.
Thanks.

Yes such a pain 5 Star - 1 Star, No I don't have that trouble.
Section 1: Players:
As a captain, do you have trouble finding enough players who's willing to sign up and pay? Yes such a pain 5 Star - 1 Star, No I don't have that trouble.
Do you have trouble recruiting certain type of players?(Female players/goalie/player with decent playing level etc)? Yes such a pain 5 Star - 1 Star, No I don't have that trouble.
If we build a NYC player database with all attributes, would you like to try to use it to post openings to recruit players? Yes I'll definitely use it. 5 star - 1 star No I'm sure I won't use it.
If we build a player database to track attendance/performance(goals/clean sheets/cards) information, and make it available for captains. Would you like to use it? Yes I'll definitely use it. 5 star - 1 star No I'm sure I won't use it.
Section 2: Leagues:
Do you have trouble finding the most suitable league for your team(Location/Schedule/Level of playing)? Yes such a pain 5 Star - 1 Star, No I don't have that trouble.
Other than season long leagues, would you like to have your team play (cheap or no fee) small-sided mini-tournaments/friendlies? Yes my team will definitely be interested to play 5 star - 1 star No I won't play those games.
If we build a mini-tournaments/friendlies database in NYC, are you likely to use it to set up games for your team? Yes I'll use it frequently. 5 star - 1 star No I won't even take a look.
Thanks for taking the survey. Last question to check if we should build this website.
If we build the website with a monthly subscription fee, (e.g: maintain a database of all NYC recreational players who's actively looking to pay to play in a league), how much would you like to pay? (only captain pays, and team members doesn't pay) up to $1 a month, up to $3 a month, up to $10 a month or I would like to contribute and work on this project with you guys.

Thanks for your support!
